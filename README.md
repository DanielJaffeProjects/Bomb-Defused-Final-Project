# Bomb Defused Final Project

Welcome to the **Bomb-Defused-Final-Project** repository! This project was a collaborative effort between Daniel and Jordano for our **Computer Science 102** final project. Together, we developed an engaging and challenging **bomb defusal game** using Python.

## üìö Project Overview

This game tasks players with defusing a bomb by completing various interactive tasks within a time limit. The gameplay incorporates:
- **Toggling switches**
- **Operating a button**
- **Using a keypad**
- **Connecting wires**

The project showcases advanced programming concepts such as **threading** and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, ensuring a seamless and immersive player experience.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following key files and resources:

- **`bomb.py`**: Main script that manages the game loop and bomb functionality.
- **`bomb_configs.py`**: Configuration file for bomb settings (e.g., timers and defusal steps).
- **`bomb_phases.py`**: Handles the various defusal tasks and phases.
- **Media Files**:
  - **Audio**: Includes sound effects
  - **Images**: Contains visual elements using GUI's
- **`Wire Psuedocode`**: Documentation outlining the logic for the wire-cutting phase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Skills

This project highlights:
- **Python Programming**: Core language used for development.
- **Threading**: To manage simultaneous tasks, such as countdowns and player interactions.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Used classes and methods.
- **Audio and Visual Integration**: Enhances player engagement through interactive elements.

## üìà Learning Outcomes

Through this project, we:
- Improved our understanding of **multithreading** and its applications in real-time scenarios.
- Enhanced our ability to collaborate on a large-scale project.
- Gained experience in integrating **media elements** into Python applications.
- Solidified our grasp of **OOP principles** in a practical context.
